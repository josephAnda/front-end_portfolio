Version 1.1.0 Updated January 11, 2016

This project contains the source code for my updated portfolio, soon to be hosted on Github pages.  In order to view the page on your own local browswer, you can download the project and then open the file titled 'index.html'.  This should automatically open up the web page in your default browser. 

What's new in 1.1.0:

Since 1.0.0, I have made a variety of upgrades to the layout and links.  Many of the previously inactive or broken links are now functional.  The layout is adaptive to the viewport size, and the menu icon animates the opening and closing of the menu.  I have also made the page live (via Github pages) and linked more of my work to the main page.  

What's to come in 1.2.0:

Images, and more descriptions upfront regarding the nature of the linked projects (e.g. mouseovers that reveal the details about the content in the link)
