Version 1.2.1 Updated January 20, 2016

This project contains the source code for my updated portfolio, soon to be hosted on Github pages.  In order to view the page on your own local browswer, you can download the project and then open the file titled 'index.html'.  This should automatically open up the web page in your default browser. 

What's new in 1.2.1:

I made the buttons more glowy, and I added a logo image (rather than plain text) for the banner 

What's to come in 1.3.0:

At least one picture of me is still in the works.  I also want to investigate changing the transition times for the brightness on the images, and perhaps the positioning of the banner.
