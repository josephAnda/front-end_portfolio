Version 1.2.0 Updated January 17, 2016

This project contains the source code for my updated portfolio, soon to be hosted on Github pages.  In order to view the page on your own local browswer, you can download the project and then open the file titled 'index.html'.  This should automatically open up the web page in your default browser. 

What's new in 1.2.0:

I cleaned up the JS implementation and used it to add mouseover descriptions as promised.  The website almost functions completely as intended.   

What's to come in 1.3.0:

At least one picture of me, as well as a logo for the banner.
